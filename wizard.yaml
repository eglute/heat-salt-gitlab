GitLab Community Edition (GitLab CE) is open source web-based Git repository manager with wiki and issue tracking features. GitLab solution on Rackspace Private Cloud provides a great open source software to collaborate on code.
architecture: |
The RPC GitLab CE solution provides a best practice architecture and solution for running GitLab server configured to run on a typical Private Cloud Configuration.
Our GitLab server deployment is designed to provide easy integration with your applications in a Private Cloud. We have configured GitLab to run seemlessley with Postfix mail delivery on the Cloud Infrastructure. 
design_specs:
- This template uses GitLab salt-formulas to configure the server. One GitLab instance will be deployed, configured with a Postfix server.
- For access to GitLab server, a floating ip will be assigned to the salt-master. Or a new server can be created in the same network as the MongoDB network. Additionally, GitLab will also be on a separete network so that applications could access your GitLab server without being on the same network.
- Any changes to the GitLab configuration can be done using Salt pillars on the Salt master.
